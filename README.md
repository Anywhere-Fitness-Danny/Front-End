# Front-End

## Mission Statement
We're simplifying fitness class registration so users can focus on whatâ€™s important: staying fit!

## Description
Anywhere Fitness facilitates the routine business transactions between clients and providers of fitness classes, allowing both sides of the transaction to spend their energies on giving and consuming fitness classes.

## Problems it Solves
1. Disorganized, failure and error prone analog experience of signing up and punching cards for fitness classes
2. Users can browse and sign up for classes online, enabling instructors to host a fitness class signupu app entirely online if they desire

## Main Features
1. Instructors can create and post fitness classes
2. Instructors can create virtual punch passes for a class that students use to access classes
3. Students can search for available classes.
4. Students can obtain (probably purchase) class punch passes from an instructor to attend a class
5. Students can reserve a spot in the class (with available seats open)
6. Students can reschedule or cancel their class registration
